    <h3>How to use it.</h3>
    <p class="lead">
        Rate the difficulty you had in recalling the answer and the app will judge how long to leave it until it asks the question again.
        <br>
        This ensures the maximum effort for recalling the information and forging stronger neural connections. Just like building muscles in the gym.
        <br>
        Efficient learning.
